# Computer-aided_VLSI_System_Design
> Computer-aided VLSI System Design (CVSD) is a course from NTU Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering , and it aims at giving a solid training in IC design.   
> I took this graduate course during my senior year of college and this repo contains all the homework in this course.
